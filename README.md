prog1.c - Get data from the user
Objective: Reads two integer values from the user within specific ranges and displays patterns of star symbols based on the user inputs.
Features: Receives inputs for nbStars and nbLines. Validates user inputs to ensure they are within acceptable ranges. Displays patterns of stars based on user inputs.
Skills Demonstrated: User input validation, basic conditional logic, and output display.

prog2.c - Display L lines of N stars
Objective: Takes two integer values, nbStars and nbLines, previously acquired from the user, and generates a pattern of star symbols based on these inputs.
Features: Utilizes values for nbStars and nbLines obtained from user input in the prior prog1.c execution. Displays a pattern of stars on the screen consisting of nbLines lines.
Each line starts with a star symbol followed by its number and a space, then displays nbStars star symbols.

prog3.c - Display adjusted patterns based on user input
Objective: Modifies the number of stars displayed per line based on the values entered by the user.
Features: Receives inputs for nbStars and nbLines. Adjusts the number of stars displayed per line based on specific conditions.
Skills Demonstrated: Advanced conditional logic, loops, and pattern generation based on user-defined criteria.

prog4.c - Compute payoff for a dice game
Objective: Computes the payoff for a dice game based on user-input dice rolls.
Features: Receives inputs for three dice rolls (R1, R2, R3). Determines the payoff according to specific rules based on the values of the dice rolls.
Skills Demonstrated: User input validation, conditional logic, function implementation, and payoff calculation.
